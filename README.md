C second language
=================

This repository hosts the course "C as a second language", given each
year at [[Telecom Nancy|http://www.telecomnancy.eu/]] since 2008.

There is many courses in C for absolute beginners out there, but this
one targets advanced beginners that have been exposed to what
programming means in another language such as Java, Scala and/or
Python, and want to learn about the mother of all languages, C.

We teach C to semi-beginners to ensure that they become better Java
programmers by betterly understanding the underlying system. The focus
is not on the very basics of programming nor on algorithmics, but on
the C programming model, that is a good abstraction of most modern
programmable systems. 

This course is also a very good introduction to the topic of
opertating systems. The rudimentary concepts of OS are presented and
worked with (processes, I/O, inter-process communication). They should
however be reinforced in futher courses afterwards.
